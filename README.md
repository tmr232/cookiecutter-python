A [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.io) template for my own projects.

This is based on how I currently configure my Python projects.
You're free to use it, but I may change it on a whim.

## Coverage.py

The configuration covers both code & tests.
This is because [You should include your tests in coverage](https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/202008/you_should_include_your_tests_in_coverage.html).

It also outputs to XML, for use with [Codecov.io](https://codecov.io).
